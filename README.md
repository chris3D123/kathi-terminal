V1
V1 runs in the terminal like any other of my projects

v2_black and v2_white
(they are the same thing just different colors)
These files run in ‘Tkinter’. You can type the commands in the bottom prompt there im multiple commands such ‘TC admin’ which will preform a terminal check. You can type a command called ‘NF admin’ which will let you create a new file. You can type in a command called ‘RF admin’ which will run a file of your choice. You can type in a command called ‘h admin’ which will show all the available commands.


(will be updated soon)
